Project Name 1: Exoneration Analysis

Brief Summary:
This project explores whether minority individuals face a higher prevalence of systemic injustice in the criminal justice system compared to non-minority individuals. The project focuses on exonerations, which occur when individuals are released from conviction due to various factors. The goal was to determine if any particular race or group faced a higher rate of unjust convictions resulting in exonerations.

Detailed Explanation:
In this project, I used SQL to clean the data and create dashboards in both Excel and Tableau. The data used in this project was obtained from https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/about.aspx. First I cleaned and transformed the data using SQL before analyzing it to answer my research question. Then I created interactive dashboards in both Excel and Tableau to present my findings.

The SQL queries used to clean the data can be found in the Exonerations.sql file. The Excel and Tableau dashboards can be found in the Exoneration Project.twbx and Exonerations_v2.xlsx files located in the Exoneration Project Folder.

Prerequisites:
For the prerequisites, it is necessary to have access to an SQL server, Microsoft Excel, and Tableau desktop. These tools are required to be installed on the user's system to be able to run the SQL queries and create visualizations using Excel and Tableau.
