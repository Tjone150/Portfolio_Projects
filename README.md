Project Name 1: Exoneration Analysis

Brief Summary:
This project explores whether minority individuals face a higher prevalence of systemic injustice in the criminal justice system compared to non-minority individuals. The project focuses on exonerations, which occur when individuals are released from conviction due to various factors. The goal was to determine if any particular race or group faced a higher rate of unjust convictions resulting in exonerations.

Detailed Explanation:
In this project, I used SQL to clean the data and create dashboards in both Excel and Tableau. The data used in this project was obtained from https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/about.aspx. First I cleaned and transformed the data using SQL before analyzing it to answer my research question. Then I created interactive dashboards in both Excel and Tableau to present my findings.

The SQL queries used to clean the data can be found in the Exonerations.sql file. The Excel and Tableau dashboards can be found in the Exoneration Project.twbx and Exonerations_v2.xlsx files located in the Exoneration Project Folder.

Prerequisites:
For the prerequisites, it is necessary to have access to an SQL server, Microsoft Excel, and Tableau desktop. These tools are required to be installed on the user's system to be able to run the SQL queries and create visualizations using Excel and Tableau.

Usage:
In order to use any of the data included in this project, please visit https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/Spread-Sheet-Request-Form.aspx and carefully read through the requirements for data usage. It is important to comply with all necessary regulations and procedures when using this data for research or analysis.

Project 2: Road Accident Analysis 

Brief Summary:
This project involved analyzing a dataset of 300,000 rows of road accident data to answer specific questions and create a dashboard. The primary KPI was total casualties that occurred post-accident, and the primary KPIs also included total casualties and the percentage of total with respect to accident severity and maximum casualties by type of vehicle. The secondary KPIs included total casualties with respect to vehicle type, monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for current year and previous year, maximum casualties by road type, distribution of total casualties by road surface, and relation between casualties by area/location & by day/night.

The dashboard was created in the order of importance from the KPIs, and it was made entirely in Excel, which is the only software needed to run it. This project provided valuable insights into Excel and its many features.

Detailed Explanation:
This project was aimed at analyzing a large dataset of road accident data to provide valuable insights into the causes of accidents and the casualties that resulted from them. The dataset consisted of 300,000 rows of data, which were analyzed to answer specific questions and create a dashboard.

The primary KPI was the total number of casualties that occurred post-accident. This was an important metric because it provided insight into the overall impact of road accidents on people's lives. The primary KPIs also included total casualties and the percentage of total with respect to accident severity and maximum casualties by type of vehicle. These metrics were important because they allowed us to understand the severity of accidents and the types of vehicles that were involved in them.

The secondary KPIs included total casualties with respect to vehicle type, monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for current year and previous year, maximum casualties by road type, distribution of total casualties by road surface, and relation between casualties by area/location & by day/night. These metrics were important because they provided additional insights into the causes and impacts of road accidents.

The dashboard was created in the order of importance from the KPIs. This made it easy to understand the most important metrics and their relationships. The dashboard was created entirely in Excel, which is the only software needed to run it. This project provided valuable insights into Excel and its many features, such as data cleaning, sorting and filtering, data processing, and data analysis.

Prerequisites:
To use the dashboard, you need to have Microsoft Excel installed on your computer.

Project 3: Sales Data Analysis

Brief Summary:
This project uses sales data to answer specific questions related to sales and market analysis. The project was implemented using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, Excel, and PowerBI. The main objective of the project is to analyze sales data and provide insights to help the company make informed decisions about their sales strategies.

Detailed Explanation:
The project provides insights on sales data, which can help the company make informed decisions about their sales strategies. The results can be used to identify the best month for sales, the city with the highest number of sales, the optimal time for displaying advertisements, the products that are often sold together, and the best-selling product. The project also calculates the probability of customers purchasing specific products, such as USB-C Charging Cable, iPhone, Google Phone, and Wired Headphones.


Prerequisites:
To implement the project, the following tools were used:
Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio: To extract and transform the data from the source
Excel: To clean and pre-process the data
PowerBI: To visualize and analyze the data


Usage:
To use the project, follow these steps:
Extract the data from the source using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
Clean and pre-process the data using Excel
Load the data into PowerBI and create visualizations
Analyze the data and draw conclusions based on the insights obtained
Use the results to make informed decisions about sales strategies and marketing campaigns

Data Source:
The data used for the project was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/knightbearr/sales-product-data. It contains information about the product, quantity ordered, price, and sales details, such as the order date, month, order time, purchase address, city, state, and zip code.

Conclusion:
The project provides valuable insights on sales data, which can help the company make informed decisions about their sales strategies. The results can be used to optimize sales campaigns, identify the best-selling products, and improve the customer experience. The project also calculates the probability of customers purchasing specific products, which can help the company anticipate demand and plan their inventory accordingly.
